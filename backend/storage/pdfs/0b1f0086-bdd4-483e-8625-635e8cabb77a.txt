Like I mentioned in the last checkin the team was really struggling. Because no one was 
available over the break (including me, I lived on a llama farm without service to become fresh 
again for the last stretch) we did not do much over the break. However, I decided to take it in my 
own hands to restructure our approach and make sure we are set up for success.  
 
With the old approach of Eiad being “just fix stuff” leading to everyone feeling overwhelmed and 
without a clue of what to do (with the result being nothing getting done) we built up a bit of a 
backlog. In the last meeting I told everyone that we would do it differently from now on and 
everyone was enthusiastic and supportive about that.  
 
I have created a kanban in the notion where I made the first few tasks and people can add more 
to make it very clear what needs to be done and who is doing what. The kanban is also the 
database for charts in the same notion which makes it very easy to see whether someone is 
contributing as much as they should. Furthermore, I created the entire frontend structure (visible 
in the link below) to make guessing what needs to be done super simple. It basically means: 
every button that does not work yet is a backend process that is missing so fix it. I have created 
a new github repo with everything and added a very comprehensive contribution guide to it 
(visible in the second link)  
 
The ui is clean and simple and has everything that we want for the app. All that's left now is to 
bring the backend together.  
 
 
 
Something to note is that Nuray has done absolutely nothing thus far as the only one and during 
meetings she is doing her makeup and not paying attention.
