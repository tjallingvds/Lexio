and
provide
all 
of
the
foregoing
Inventions
(the
“

to
the 
Company.
However,
the
foregoing
does
not
purport
to
assign
to 
the
Company
(and
Assigned
Inventions
shall
not
include)
any 
Invention
that:
(1)
by
law
(including,
without
limitation,
the 
applicable
statutory
provision
for
my
state
of
employment
set 
forth
in
Appendix

,
if
any)

may

whether
in
electronic
or

form),
except
that
I
may
keep

c.
Company
Systems
.  I
also
recognize
and
agree
that
I 
have
no
expectation
of
privacy
with
respect
to
the
Company’s 
networks,
telecommunications
systems
or
information
processing 
systems
(including,
without
limitation,
stored
computer
files, 
email
messages
and
voicemail
messages
or
other
devices 
(including
personal
devices))
in
which
Company
Proprietary 
Information
resides,
is
stored
or
is
passed
through
(collectively, 
“
Company
Systems
”),
and
in
order
to
ensure
compliance
with 
work
rules
and
safety
concerns,
the
Company
or
its
agents
may 
monitor,
at
any
time
and
without
further
notice
to
me,
any 
Company
Systems
and
any
of
my
activity,
files
or
messages
on
or 
using
any
Company
Systems,
regardless
of
whether
such
activity 
occurs
on
equipment
owned
by
me
or
the
Company.
I
further 
agree
that
any
property
situated
on
the
Company’s
premises
and 
owned,
leased
or
otherwise
possessed
by
the
Company,
including 
computers,
computer
files,

filing 
cabinets
or
other
work
areas,
is
subject
to
inspection
by
Company 
personnel
at
any
time
with
or
without
notice.
I
understand
and 
acknowledge
that
(A)
any
such
searches
or
monitoring
efforts
are 
not
formal
accusations
of
wrongdoing
but
rather
part
of
the 
procedure
of
an
investigation
and
(B)
refusal
to
consent
to
such
a 
search
may
be
grounds
for

Acknowledgments.
i.
I
acknowledge
and
agree
that
(A)
the
Company's 
business
is
highly
competitive;
(B)
secrecy
of
the
Proprietary 
Information
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
Company,
and
I 
will
learn
and
use
Proprietary
Information
in
the
course
of 
performing
my
work
for
the
Company
and
(C)
my
position
may 
require
me
to
establish
goodwill
with
Business
Partners
and 
employees
on
behalf
of
the
Company
and
such
goodwill
is 
extremely
important
to
the
Company’s
success,
and
the
Company 
has
made
substantial
investments
to
develop
its
business
interests 
and
goodwill.
ii.
I
agree
that
the
limitations
as
to
time,
geographical
area 
and
scope
of
activity
to
be
restrained
in
this
Section
4
are 
coextensive
with
the
Company’s
footprint
and
my
performance
of 
responsibilities
for
the
Company
and
are
therefore
reasonable
and 
not
greater
than
necessary
to
protect
the
goodwill
or
other 
business
interests
of
the
Company.
I
further
agree
that
such 
investments
are
worthy
of
protection
and
that
the
Company’s 
need
for
protection
afforded
by
this
Section
4
is
greater
than
any 
hardship
I
may
experience
by
complying
with
its
terms.
iii.
I
acknowledge
that
my
violation
or
attempted
violation 
of
the
agreements
in
this
Section
4
will
cause
irreparable
damage 
to
the
Company
or
its
Affiliates,
and
I
therefore
agree
that
the 
Company
shall
be
entitled
as
a
matter
of
right
to
an
injunction
out 
of
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
restraining
any
violation
or 
further
violation
of
such
agreements
by
me
or
others
acting
on
my 
behalf.
The
Company’s
right
to
injunctive
relief
shall
be 
cumulative
and
in
addition
to
any
other
remedies
provided
by
law 
or
equity.
iv.
Although
the
parties
believe
that
the
limitations
as
to 
time,
geographical
area
and
scope
of
activity
contained
herein
are 
reasonable
and
do
not
impose
a
greater
restraint
than
necessary
to 
protect
the
goodwill
or
other
business
interests
of
the
Company,
if 
it
is
judicially
determined
otherwise,
the
limitations
shall
be 
reformed
to
the
extent
necessary
to
make
them
reasonable
and
not 
to
impose
a
restraint
that
is
greater
than
necessary
to
protect
the 
goodwill
or
other
business
interests
of
the
Company.
v.
In
any
such
case,
the
Company
and
I
agree
that
the 
remaining
provisions
of
this
Section
4
shall
be
valid
and
binding 
as
though
any
invalid
or
unenforceable
provision
had
not
been 
included.
c.
As
an
Employee.
  During
my
employment
with
the 
Company,
I
will
not

or
indirectly:
(i) Cause
any
person
to 
cease
or
reduce
their

(as
an

or
otherwise)
to
the 
Company
(other
than,
in
the
course
of
my
duties
for
the 
Company,
terminating
subordinate
employees
or
reducing
the 
work
of
or
terminating
consultants);
(ii) Solicit
any
Business 
Partner;
(iii) act
in
any
capacity
in
or
with
respect
to
any 
commercial
activity
which
competes,
or
is
reasonably
likely
to 
compete,
with
any
business
that
the
Company
conducts,
proposes 
to
conduct
or
demonstrably
anticipates
conducting,
at
any
time 
during
my
employment
with
the
Company
or
(iv)
enter
into
in
an
employment,
consulting
or
other
similar
relationship
with
another 
person
or
entity
that
requires
a
significant
time
commitment 
without
the
prior
written
consent
of
the
Company.
d.
After
Termination.
  Unless
I
am
a
resident
of
California 
or
Colorado,
for
the
period
of
twelve
(12)
months
immediately 
following
my
termination
of
employment
with
the
Company
(for 
any
or
no
reason,
whether
voluntary
or
involuntary),
I
will
not 
directly
or
indirectly:
(i)
Cause
any

to
cease
or
reduce
their 
services
(as
an
employee
or
otherwise)
to
the
Company;
(ii) 
Solicit
any
Business
Partner;
or
(iii)
engage
in
any
Competitive 
Activities
(A)
anywhere
the
Company
offers
its
services
or
has 
customers
during
my
employment
with
the
Company
or
where 
my
use
or
disclosure
of
Proprietary
Information
could
materially 
disadvantage
the
Company
regardless
of
my
physical
location;
or 
(B)
anywhere
the
Company
offers
its
services
or
has
customers 
and
where
I
have
responsibility
for
the
Company;
or
(C) 
anywhere
within
a
fifty
(50)
mile
radius
of
any
physical
location
I 
work
for
the
Company.
The
foregoing
timeframes
shall
be 
increased
by
the
period
of
time
beginning
from
the 
commencement
of
any
violation
of
the
foregoing
provisions
until 
such
time
as
I
have
cured
such
violation.
5.
Employment
at
Will.
  I
agree
that
this
Agreement
is
not 
an
employment

for
any
particular
term.
I
have
the
right 
to
resign
and
the
Company
has
the
right
to
terminate
my 
employment
at
will,
at
any
time,
for
any
or
no
reason,
with
or 
without

This
Agreement
does
not
purport
to
set
forth
all
of 
the
terms
and
conditions
of
my
employment,
and
as
an
employee 
of
the
Company,
I
have
obligations
to
the
Company
which
are
not 
described
in
this
Agreement.
However,
the
terms
of
this 
Agreement
govern
over
any
such
terms
that
are
inconsistent
with 
this
Agreement,
and
supersede
the
terms
of
any
similar
form
that
I 
may
have
previously
signed.
This
Agreement
can
only
be 
changed
by
a
subsequent
written
agreement
signed
by
the
Chief 
Executive
Officer
or
President
of
the
Company,
or

Directors.

Activity
Not
Prohibited.
I
understand
that 
nothing

disclosing
documents
or
other
information
as 
permitted
by
law,
without
giving
notice
to,
or
receiving 
authorization
from,
the
Company.
Notwithstanding
the
foregoing, 
in
making
any
such
disclosures
or
communications,
I
agree
to 
take
all
reasonable
precautions
to
prevent
any

will
cause

An

between
an

(4)
Notwithstanding
Subsection

an

is
enforceable
under
Subsection

if
the
employee's
employment
or
continuation
of
employment
is
not
conditioned
on
the
employee's 
acceptance
of
such
agreement
and
the

receives
a

under
such
agreement
which
is
not
compensation

recites
such
consideration. 
(6)
An

(8)
Nothing
